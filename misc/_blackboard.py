The goal of a text editor is to make modifications to a text.
More generally, the user should also be able to modify things other
than text, such as options or other meta stuff.
We store all relevant data for editing a text in a single object,
and call this object a document.

To make modifications to a document, we define commands.
An command is an abstract object that can make a modification to a
document. An command must therefore be executable (read: callable)
and accept a document as argument.

Snippet expansion should be trivial due to our abstract machinery.
There are several possibilities.
Do we want to make it a single command, or do we want to have an command for each placeholder?
In the first case we have to make it a CompoundAction.
In the second case we can either store the commands in advance (annoying to implement)
or store a snippet object in the document which is updateable and subsequently stores
placeholder commands in the undotree.
This requires a seperate field for updateable commands.
Updateable commands are then no longer determined from the last command in the history,
but have a separate field.

Generally speaking, we want to interact with a general object/command (that is not necessarily undoable).
In this case, a snippet object.
While interacting with the snippet object, we get multiple other intercommands with ChangeInPlace operations.

So we need to think about how to implement intercommand in the most general way.
We can introduce an intercommand stack, such that we can nest intercommands.
If we then finish an intercommand, we are dropped into the previous intercommand.
By default we must interact through characters that are typed by the user.
This is not very configurable, so for some interactive commands we must use other intercommand data.
In those cases, support by the user interface is needed, to translate the users insertions to the data of choice.
An alternative is to move this part to the fate core, but that kind of denies the design statement of splitting the user interface from the core.
To generalize ui support for the intercommands, we maybe could have dictionaries for the different types of intercommands.

SOLUTION:
The UI must have knowledge about subclasses of Interactive, like InsertOperation, en have interpretation functions for them. That can be a
dict: key -> func, but also a function that translates keys to characters and passes them to the insert method of InsertOperation
